    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a software engineer who never really stopped being curious.</p>
    <p>
      I like building things. Digital things. Systems. Tiny experiments. Big
      ideas. I like taking something vague and slowly giving it shape until it
      works, and then refining it until it feels right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've spent my career inside product teams, helping turn concepts into real
      platforms people rely on. I care about craft. About thoughtful
      architecture. About naming things well. About shipping. I believe good
      software isn't just code that runs. It's code that communicates.
    </p>
    <p>At heart, I'm a tinkerer.</p>
    <p>
      I learn by pulling things apart. I'll open up engines, inspect assets,
      trace requests, and follow data just to understand how something really
      works. Not because I have to, but because I want to. Curiosity is fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I'm drawn to systems of all kinds: games, tools,
      workflows, mechanics. I love how small rules create surprising outcomes. I
      love watching structure and creativity collide. I love the moment when a
      messy idea suddenly clicks into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe technology is one of the most powerful creative mediums we've
      ever had. It can connect, amplify, distort, inspire, sometimes all at
      once. I try to approach it with both optimism and realism, with enthusiasm
      and discernment.
    </p>
    <p>This space is where I think out loud.</p>
    <p>
      You'll find reflections on building, leading, experimenting, and
      occasionally questioning the direction of it all. Some posts will be
      technical. Some philosophical. Some just explorations of ideas that
      wouldn't leave me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you enjoy building for the sake of building, and you still get a small
      spark of joy when something finally works, you'll probably feel at home
      here.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
